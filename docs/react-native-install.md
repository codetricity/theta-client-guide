## Overview

Guide covers the installation process of React Native on **Windows OS** so that we can run the R. Another section will cover the installation for Mac OS. For this installation you will need to install **node.js** if you haven't already. Their will be videos and links in the resource section for the installation of node.js on your computer. Article also covers how to build the `theta-client` and make it available to `demo-react-native`. As well as building the `demo-react-native` and running it on an android emulator. My results will be shown in the article with the **THETA X** running the react native demo app provided by the RICOH API.
