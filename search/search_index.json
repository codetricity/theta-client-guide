The library works with Kotlin, Swift, Dart, and JavaScript. Demo Apps Four open source demo applications are included: Android native with Kotlin iOS native with Swift React Native for iOS and Android builds Flutter for iOS and Android builds Documentation Refer to theta-client documentation for the development platform you are using. Android iOS React Native Flutter In addition to documentation on theta-client, you can refer to the RICOH official Web API 2.1 documentation .
